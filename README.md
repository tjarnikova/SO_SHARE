### SO_SHARE is a tidier cousin to [SOZONE](https://github.com/tjarnikova/SOZONE), my main analysis repository for work in the GreenOcean Modelling Group at UEA. 

The idea is to be able to code/experiment/be structurally messy in SOZONE, and once things are share-able and legible to put them here for reference.
